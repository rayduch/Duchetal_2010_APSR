# Coalition-Directed Voting in Multi-Party Democracies

Raymond M. Duch, Jeff May and David Armstrong (2010), American Political Science Review

election outcomes. We propose a theory of the coalition-directed vote. The argument suggests that
voters anticipate the postelection bargains negotiated among potential members of the governing
coalition and that these anticipated policy agreements inform their vote choice. Our analysis, based on
86 voter preference surveys from 23 countries and over a 25-year period, confirms that coalition-directed
voting occurs with considerable frequency in contexts with multiparty coalition governments
